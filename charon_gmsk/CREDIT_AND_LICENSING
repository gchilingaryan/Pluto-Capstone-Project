PlutoSDR Firmware for the [ADALM-PLUTO](https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto "PlutoSDR Wiki Page") Active Learning Module

The ADALM-PLUTO SDR firmware is a collection of components, computer programs and documents created by a range of individuals, 
teams and companies. Most of the components are open source packages, developed independently, and accompanied by separate 
license terms (such as GPL, LGPL, BSD, MIT, Apache, modified BSD or others). Your license rights with respect to individual components
accompanied by separate license terms are defined by those terms (The license agreement for each component is generally 
located in the component's source code); nothing shall restrict, limit, or otherwise affect any rights or obligations you may
have, or conditions to which you may be subject, under such license terms. This agreement does not limit your rights under, 
or grant you rights that supersede, the license terms of any particular component.

With the potential exception of certain firmware files, the license terms of components normally included in the 
ADALM-PLUTO SDR firmware normally permit you to copy, modify, and redistribute the component, in both source code
and binary code forms.

You are free to re-use any indivual or multiple components in an end product that you create, but it is up to you and 
your legal team to make sure your product complies with the licensing requirements of whatever software package that 
you include in your product.

You may make and use unlimited copies of the ADALM-PLUTO SDR firmware for your distribution and use within your organization. 
You may make and distribute unlimited copies of the ADALM-PLUTO SDR firmware outside your organization.

# NO WARRANTY

BECAUSE THE ADALM-PLUTO SDR FIRMWARE IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS”
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE 
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY 
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO 
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
